# Ethical Conduct

#### **1. Competence**

Lawyers must know what they’re doing. They should be properly trained, prepared, and stay updated on the law.

***

#### **2. Client Confidentiality**

Anything a client shares must stay private—unless the client says otherwise or the law requires it.

***

#### **3. Conflicts of Interest**

Lawyers can’t represent someone if there’s a conflict with another client, unless **everyone involved agrees in writing** and it’s fair to all sides.

***

#### **4. Honesty with the Court**

Lawyers must always tell the truth to the judge and not hide or lie about facts or evidence.

***

#### **5. Fair Play**

Don’t block the other side from seeing evidence, mess with documents, or encourage anyone to lie in court.

***

#### **6. Professional Integrity**

Lawyers must act with honesty and respect. Lying, cheating, or committing crimes can get them suspended or disbarred.

***

#### **7. Reporting Bad Behavior**

If a lawyer sees another lawyer doing something seriously unethical, they have to report it. Keeping quiet is also a violation.

***

#### **8. No Harassment or Discrimination**

No racist, sexist, abusive, or hateful behavior is allowed in legal work—ever. It’s taken seriously and will lead to serious consequences.

***

#### **9. When This Applies**

These rules apply to everyone working as a lawyer in the DOJ, right away. They’ll be updated if the real-world rules change.
