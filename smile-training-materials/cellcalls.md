## Arrest and Attorney Rights

1. **Informing the Suspect**\
   When a Law Enforcement Officer (LEO) arrests a suspect, the officer must inform the suspect of their right to an attorney.
2. **Attorney Request**
   * If the suspect requests an attorney, ask if they have a private attorney or need a public defender.
   * The officer must contact the DOJ by:
     * Using the DOJ radio channel (11).
     * Calling a lawyer or public defender directly.
3. **No Attorney Request**\
   If the suspect does not request an attorney, process them as you would normally.
4. If the suspect does not request an attorney, and a wishes to plead Not Guilty, they may request a bench trial with a judge to determine if they are fit to represent themselves.

## District Attorney Contact

1. **Contacting the DA**\
   If the suspect’s attorney has been contacted, the officer must also reach out to the District Attorney’s Office using the same methods.
2. **Unavailable DA**\
   If the District Attorney is unavailable, the arresting officer assumes the role of negotiating with the suspect’s attorney.
3. **Negotiations**\
   Negotiations begin once both legal counsels have spoken with their respective clients (the DA’s client being the police department).
   * If both legal representatives are unavailable, process the suspect as you would normally. (If the suspect wishes to defend themselves, request and with a bench trial docket).&#x20;

## Bench Trials and Plea Deals

1. **Complicated Charges**
   * Charges such as murder or weapons trafficking, or any charges more than 50 months, are not eligible for plea deals if a Judge is available. These cases must be held in a bench trial to ensure fairness to officers and the community, if a bench trial is requested.
   * If no Judge is available, proceed with the plea deal as normal.
2. **Plea Deals**
   * If a plea deal is reached, the suspect is fined and sentenced according to the negotiated agreement.
   * If a lawyer is present during negotiations, officers or the DA / ADA may offer up to 50% off time or fines with a guilty plea.
     * Discounts should be based on the roleplay provided by the suspect and lawyer.
3. **No Agreement**\
   If no agreement is reached and all parties wish to pursue a full trial:
   * The suspect must pay a bail bond fee (double the fine amount) and have an ankle monitor applied.
   * If the suspect cannot afford bail, they will be sent to Bolingbroke for their full time and full fine. If at the time of the trial the suspect is issued a not guilty verdict, the suspect will be issued compensation for their time at the judge's discretion.&#x20;

## Options When No Lawyer is Available

1. **Discount Option**
   * Suspects may be eligible for up to a 25% discount on fines or time (not both).
2. **Not Guilty or No Contest Plea**
   * If the suspect pleads not guilty or no contest and pays bail, they will schedule a court date.
     * If they win the case, they are reimbursed for fines and bail.
     * If they lose, they forfeit the bail money, and the judge sentences them.
     * The suspect must open a docket with the assistance of their attorney. The suspect themselves must open the docket. Without the docket being opened in 48 hours the case will be classified as null.&#x20;
3. **Unable to Pay Bail**
   * If the suspect pleads not guilty and cannot afford bail, they will be held for full time and fine.
4. **Flight Risk**
   * If the suspect is deemed a flight risk, they will be held full time and fine.&#x20;
   * If the suspect does not show up to court they may be charged twice their original time and fine.&#x20;
   * Officers must prove the flight risk beyond a reasonable doubt in court.

## Bail Information

1. **Setting Bail**
   * When a suspect pleads not guilty, bail should be set at double the current fine.
   * Notify the DOJ via “DOJ Pings” in the LEO email. Both the Public Defender’s Office (PDO) and District Attorney’s Office (DA) should be notified.
2. **Ankle Monitors**
   * Suspects who pay bail and have an ankle monitor applied must be logged in the Active Anklet Monitors in LEO emails.
   *   Update their MDT profile using the following template:

       ```
       Date Applied | Case# | Suspect Name | CSN
       ```
   * Use the command `/anklet CID` to apply the monitor.
3. **Bail Conditions**
