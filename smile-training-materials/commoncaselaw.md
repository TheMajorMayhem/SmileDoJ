## Key Legal Cases

### Miranda v. Arizona  
The Supreme Court’s decision in **Miranda v. Arizona** addressed four different cases involving custodial interrogations. In each case, the defendant was questioned by police officers, detectives, or a prosecuting attorney in a room where they were cut off from the outside world. None of the defendants were given a full and effective warning of their rights at the outset of the interrogation process. The questioning elicited oral admissions, and in three cases, signed statements were admitted at trial.

### Terry v. Ohio  
Under the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, a police officer may stop a suspect on the street and frisk them without probable cause to arrest, provided the officer has a reasonable suspicion that the person has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime and has a reasonable belief that the person "may be armed and presently dangerous."

### Pennsylvania v. Mimms  
After police officers stopped a respondent’s automobile for being operated with an expired license plate, one officer asked the respondent to step out of the car and produce their license and registration. As the respondent exited, the officer noticed a large bulge under their jacket, frisked them, and found a loaded revolver. The respondent was arrested and indicted for carrying a concealed weapon and an unlicensed firearm. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court reversed the conviction, citing a Fourth Amendment violation. However, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed this decision, holding that the officers acted appropriately.

### Tennessee v. Garner  
Under the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, a police officer may use deadly force to prevent the escape of a fleeing suspect only if the officer has a good-faith belief that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others.

### Accomplice Doctrine  
An accomplice is defined as a person who knowingly, voluntarily, or intentionally gives assistance to another in (or, in some cases, fails to prevent another from) the commission of a crime. An accomplice is criminally liable to the same extent as the principal. Unlike an accessory, an accomplice is typically present when the crime is committed.

## Common Law Objections

### 1. Relevance  
**Description**: The evidence or question is not related to the facts at issue in the case.  
**Example**: If a lawyer asks a witness about their favorite hobby during a car accident case, the opposing counsel might object: “Objection, relevance.”

---

### 2. Hearsay  
**Description**: A statement made outside of court is being offered as evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.  
**Example**: If a witness says, “John told me he saw the defendant speeding,” the opposing lawyer might object: “Objection, hearsay.”  
**Exceptions**: There are many exceptions to the hearsay rule, such as excited utterances or statements against interest.

---

### 3. Leading Question  
**Description**: During direct examination, a lawyer asks a question that suggests the answer.  
**Example**: “You saw the defendant leave the house, didn’t you?” might draw the objection: “Objection, leading.”  
**Note**: Leading questions are allowed during cross-examination.

---

### 4. Speculation  
**Description**: The witness is asked to guess or infer something outside their direct knowledge.  
**Example**: “Why do you think the defendant was angry?” could result in: “Objection, speculation.”

---

### 5. Lack of Foundation  
**Description**: The lawyer has not established enough context to make the evidence or testimony admissible.  
**Example**: Before asking about a document, the lawyer must establish what it is and where it came from. Failure to do so could prompt: “Objection, lack of foundation.”

---

### 6. Argumentative  
**Description**: The lawyer’s question is more of a statement or attempt to argue with the witness rather than elicit factual testimony.  
**Example**: “So you expect us to believe you didn’t see the red light?” might lead to: “Objection, argumentative.”

---

### 7. Asked and Answered  
**Description**: The lawyer is repeating questions that have already been sufficiently answered.  
**Example**: If the lawyer asks the same question in slightly different forms, the opposing counsel might object: “Objection, asked and answered.”

---

### 8. Improper Character Evidence  
**Description**: Evidence is introduced to show a person’s character to prove they acted in accordance with that character on a specific occasion.  
**Example**: “The defendant has always been dishonest.” could result in: “Objection, improper character evidence.”  
**Exceptions**: Character evidence is admissible under certain circumstances, such as when it pertains to truthfulness in credibility.

---

### 9. Lack of Personal Knowledge  
**Description**: A witness is testifying about something they did not directly observe or experience.  
**Example**: “I heard from someone else that the defendant was speeding.” might draw: “Objection, lack of personal knowledge.”

---

### 10. Improper Opinion  
**Description**: A non-expert witness gives an opinion instead of stating facts.  
**Example**: “I think the defendant caused the accident.” could prompt: “Objection, improper opinion.”

---

### 11. Misstates Evidence  
**Description**: A lawyer misrepresents prior evidence or testimony in their question or argument.  
**Example**: “You said earlier the light was red,” when the witness had actually said it was green, might lead to: “Objection, misstates evidence.”

---

### 12. Vague or Ambiguous  
**Description**: The question is unclear and could confuse the witness or lead to multiple interpretations.  
**Example**: “What happened next?” in a complex context could prompt: “Objection, vague.”

---

### 13. Calls for Narrative  
**Description**: The question invites the witness to give a long, unfocused response instead of concise, relevant facts.  
**Example**: “Tell us everything that happened that day.” might lead to: “Objection, calls for narrative.”

---

### 14. Cumulative  
**Description**: Evidence or testimony is being repeated unnecessarily and wastes the court's time.  
**Example**: After several witnesses have already testified to the same fact, the opposing counsel might object: “Objection, cumulative.”

---

### 15. Prejudicial vs. Probative  
**Description**: The evidence’s potential to unfairly prejudice the jury outweighs its value in proving a fact.  
**Example**: Graphic photographs introduced solely to inflame the jury could lead to: “Objection, unfairly prejudicial.”

Lawyers use these objections strategically to shape the narrative of the case and ensure a fair trial within the bounds of legal procedure.
