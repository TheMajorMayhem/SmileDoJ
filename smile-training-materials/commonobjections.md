## Objections and Explanations  

---

### Leading Question  
**Description**: A leading question suggests the answer or contains information that the witness is not yet aware of.  
**When Allowed**: Leading questions are generally not allowed during direct examination but are permitted during cross-examination.  
**Example**:  
- Prosecution: "Isn't it true that you saw the defendant steal the car?"  
- Defense: "Objection, leading question."  

---

### Compound Question  
**Description**: A compound question contains multiple inquiries, making it difficult for the witness to provide a clear and accurate response.  
**Remedy**: Break the compound question into separate questions.  
**Example**:  
- "Isn’t it true you visit the Looney Bar every Wednesday, and you were there until 2 a.m. that night?"  
- Objection: "Objection, compound question."  

---

### Argumentative  
**Description**: A question is argumentative when it does not seek new information but instead challenges the witness or draws conclusions. This can also be referred to as "badgering the witness."  
**Example**:  
- "Do you expect the jury to believe someone who lives in your neighborhood can afford a luxury car?"  
- Objection: "Objection, argumentative."  

---

### Asked and Answered  
**Description**: This objection is raised when an attorney repeats a question that has already been sufficiently answered.  
**Example**:  
- Examiner: "So you drove from Fresno to Las Vegas on November 8th?"  
- Witness: "That is correct."  
- Examiner: "So you didn’t stay in Fresno on November 8th?"  
- Objection: "Objection, asked and answered."  

---

### Vague or Ambiguous  
**Description**: A question is unclear or lacks specificity, making it difficult for the witness to provide a meaningful answer.  
**Example**:  
- "Tell us about the incident."  
- Objection: "Objection, vague and ambiguous."  

---

### Non-Responsive Witness  
**Description**: This objection is made when the witness does not provide an answer to the question asked.

### Hearsay  
**Description**: Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Hearsay is generally inadmissible unless it falls under an exception.  
**Example**:  
- "John told me he saw the defendant speeding."  
- Objection: "Objection, hearsay."  

---

### Relevance  
**Description**: Evidence must be relevant to be admissible in court. Relevant evidence makes a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence.  
**Example**:  
- Prosecution introduces evidence of a prior arrest unrelated to the current charges.  
- Objection: "Objection, relevance."  

---

### Character Evidence  
**Description**: Evidence of a person’s character is generally inadmissible to prove they acted in accordance with that character on a specific occasion.  
**Example**:  
- "The defendant has always been dishonest."  
- Objection: "Objection, character evidence."  

---

### Speculation  
**Description**: A question or testimony that requires the witness to guess or infer something outside their direct knowledge.  
**Example**:  
- "What do you think the defendant’s intentions were?"  
- Objection: "Objection, speculation."  

---

### Privilege  
**Description**: Questions that seek information protected by privilege, such as attorney-client privilege, are objectionable.  
**Example**:  
- "What discussions have you and your lawyer had about the settlement?"  
- Objection: "Objection, privilege."  

---

### Best Evidence Rule  
**Description**: The best evidence rule requires the original document, recording, or photograph to be presented unless it is unobtainable.  
**Example**:  
- A party attempts to introduce a copy of a contract when the original is available.  
- Objection: "Objection, best evidence rule."  

---

### Outside Scope of Cross-Examination  
**Description**: Redirect examination is limited to issues raised during cross-examination. Questions outside this scope are objectionable.  

---

### More Prejudicial Than Probative  
**Description**: Evidence may be excluded if its potential to unfairly prejudice the jury substantially outweighs its probative value.  
**Example**:  
- Graphic photographs introduced solely to inflame the jury.  
- Objection: "Objection, more prejudicial than probative."  

---

### Narrative  
**Description**: A narrative occurs when the witness provides a long, uninterrupted statement instead of answering the specific question asked.  
**Example**:  
- "Describe what happened on the day of the crime."  
- Objection: "Objection, calls for narrative."  

---

### Foundation  
**Description**: A witness must provide enough background facts to show they are qualified to testify on the matter.  
**Example**:  
- Q: "How would you describe Ms. Miller’s relationship with her grandparents?"  
- Objection: "Objection, lack of foundation."
