# MOTION TO COMPEL DISCOVERY  

Now comes the Defendant, by way of counsel, to move this Court to compel the State to fully comply with its discovery obligations. In support of this motion, the Defendant sets forth the following facts and argument.  

As soon as practicable after receiving a timely request from the Defendant, the State shall produce and permit the inspection, duplication, copying, and photography, by or on behalf of the Defendant, of any offense reports, designated documents, papers, written or recorded statements of law enforcement officers (excluding the work product of counsel for the State and their investigators, as well as their notes or reports), or any designated books, accounts, letters, photographs, objects, or other tangible things not otherwise privileged that constitute or contain evidence material to any matter involved in the action and that are in the possession, custody, or control of the State or any person under contract with the State.  

The Defendant requests that the following items be provided for discovery, as they have yet to be produced for the Defendant or relevant counsel:  

- Any charge sheet(s), indictment(s), and criminal complaint(s) connected to the criminal matter at hand.  
- Any witness statement(s) connected to the criminal matter at hand, including the names attached to the statements.  
- Any other evidentiary items attached to the criminal matter at hand.  

The Defendant and counsel request that, within 48 hours of this notice being placed into effect, discovery be delivered via Express Telegram, paid for by the State (Discord). Failure to comply should result in dismissal of the case, as it does not meet the prima facie requirement to proceed with a criminal prosecution.
