# NDA

A **Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)** is a legally binding contract that protects confidential information from being shared with unauthorized parties. NDAs are commonly used in business, employment, and legal agreements to ensure sensitive data remains private.

***

## When an NDA Should Be Used

An NDA is appropriate when:

1. **Confidential information needs protection**\
   Such as trade secrets, business strategies, or client data.
2. **Two or more parties are discussing sensitive matters**\
   For example, a company hiring a contractor or negotiating a merger.
3. **A company is sharing proprietary knowledge**\
   Such as software code, designs, or research.
4. **An employee or contractor has access to sensitive data**\
   Preventing them from sharing or using it for personal gain.

***

## Common Cases Where NDAs Are Used

1. **Business Partnerships & Mergers**\
   Companies may require NDAs before discussing financials or proprietary information.
2. **Employee & Contractor Agreements**\
   Employers use NDAs to prevent staff from sharing sensitive business data.
3. **Product Development & Patents**\
   Protecting ideas, formulas, and designs before patents are filed.
4. **Investor & Venture Capital Deals**\
   Investors may need insight into a company’s finances, requiring confidentiality.
5. **Client-Vendor Agreements**\
   Service providers working with confidential client data often sign NDAs.
6. **Technology & Software Development**\
   NDAs prevent developers from leaking code, algorithms, or trade secrets.

## Key Elements of an NDA

1. **Parties Involved**\
   Names of individuals or companies agreeing to confidentiality.
2. **Definition of Confidential Information**\
   Specifies what is considered private and protected.
3. **Obligations of the Receiving Party**\
   Outlines restrictions on sharing, copying, or using the information.
4. **Duration of the Agreement**\
   Defines how long confidentiality must be maintained (e.g., 2-5 years, indefinitely).
5. **Exclusions from Confidentiality**\
   Lists information that does not require protection, such as publicly known data.
6. **Consequences of Breach**\
   Specifies legal actions if a party violates the NDA, such as financial damages or injunctions.

## Types of NDAs

1. **Unilateral NDA**\
   One party agrees to keep another party’s information confidential (e.g., an employee NDA).
2. **Mutual NDA**\
   Both parties agree to protect shared confidential information (e.g., business negotiations).
3. **Multilateral NDA**\
   Used when three or more parties are involved in sensitive discussions.

## What Happens If an NDA Is Violated?

   The injured party can sue for damages in civil court.
2. **Injunctions**\
   A court may issue an injunction to prevent further disclosure.
3. **Liability**\
