# IC vs. OOC Legal Concepts

### **Purpose**

This document outlines the relationship between real-world (OOC) case law and the evolving legal structure within the city (IC). It establishes a framework where realistic legal standards guide roleplay, but also allows for meaningful in-character development and legal progression through judge rulings and precedent.

***

### **1. Definitions**

* **IC (In-Character)**: Anything occurring within the roleplay world. This includes trials, rulings, statutes, case law, and legal actions made by in-game actors (judges, attorneys, etc.).
* **OOC (Out-of-Character)**: Real-world references, including U.S. case law, the Constitution, ABA rules, and state/federal precedent. Used as a baseline to guide realistic RP but not binding unless integrated IC.

***

### **2. Legal Standards in the City**

* The city’s legal framework is inspired by **real-world U.S. law**, but it is not bound to mirror it exactly.
* **In-Character laws and precedents supersede real-world law** in all courtroom and legal RP settings unless no IC guidance exists.

***

### **3. Case Law in the City**

* Judges and legal officials may **cite real-world precedent** in their arguments or decisions if applicable.
* However, once an **IC ruling is made**, it becomes **city case law**, setting precedent for future cases—even if it differs from the real world.

***

### **4. Role of Judges in Case Development**

* Judges are encouraged to **convene in chambers** to discuss and debate legal interpretation of real-world law before setting IC precedent.
* This allows for:
  * **Realistic adaptation** of complex laws
  * **Creative flexibility** in making the city’s legal system its own
  * Creation of **new IC case law** through argument and RP, rather than defaulting to RL answers

***

### **5. Example**

* **OOC Reference**: _Miranda v. Arizona (1966)_ – requires police to read rights.
* **IC Adaptation**: Judges may rule that Miranda rights must be read, but define **different standards** for what counts as "custody" in the city based on IC needs.

***

### **6. Changing the Law Through RP**

* Lawyers and judges may **challenge** existing case law through RP motions, appeals, or new arguments.
* The **DOJ or Judicial Review Board** may vote to overturn, uphold, or revise case law based on:
  * IC legal reasoning
  * RP events or shifts in the city’s legal climate
  * Public outcry or political RP

***

### **7. Legal Continuity**

* Once IC case law is created, it is binding unless formally overturned or revised.
* A panel of all judges may be challenged on case law to overturn or revise upon legal request.&#x20;
