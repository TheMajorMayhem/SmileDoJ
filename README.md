# Welcome To Smile DoJ

This documentation has been removed entirely based on the confrontation of me being removed from all communities in the Smile-Verse. It took me 3 weeks of dedicated work to put together, and unfortunately it's taking up space in my repos. If you have existing backups of my work here please feel free to utilize it. Outside of this I have zero intentions on assisting a DOJ that is completely backwards. \
\
I wish you all luck, but without proper staff understanding for how this is suppose to work in a city, the DOJ will never have good RP. This city is COP first and EVERYONE else after... which has been proven to be shown as a poor model (Nopixel, Prodigy, ONYX, and other major cities have all seen this). \
\
Without a DOJ group that loves and cares for Justice in the city, you're playing cops and robbers and that's not really RP. \
\
Thanks for attending my TED Talk. Best of luck.&#x20;
