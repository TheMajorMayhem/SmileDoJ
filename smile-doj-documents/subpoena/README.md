# Subpoena

A **Subpoena** is a legal document that commands a person to either testify as a witness in a court case or produce evidence (such as documents or records) relevant to the case. There are two main types of subpoenas:

* **Subpoena Ad Testificandum**: Requires the recipient to appear and testify as a witness.
* **Subpoena Duces Tecum**: Requires the recipient to produce specific documents, records, or other evidence for inspection.

Subpoenas are often used in litigation to compel the production of critical evidence or testimony when a party cannot secure it voluntarily.

## When a Subpoena Should Be Used

A subpoena is appropriate when:

1. **You need to compel someone to testify**\
   This can be in court or during a deposition.
2. **You require the production of documents or evidence**\
   For example, business records, emails, contracts, or other materials relevant to the case.
3. **A witness or third party is refusing to provide information voluntarily**\
   When the party refuses to participate or share relevant documents, a subpoena is used to compel their compliance.
4. **You need to obtain information from someone who is not part of the lawsuit**\
   A subpoena can be issued to a non-party who has knowledge or evidence relevant to the case.
5. **You need information in advance of a trial or hearing**\
   Subpoenas can be issued before the trial to collect evidence.
