# Motion to Compel Discovery

A **Motion to Compel Discovery** is a formal request made to the court asking it to order a party in a lawsuit to comply with discovery obligations. Discovery is the process through which each party exchanges evidence and information relevant to the case. If one party fails to provide requested information or documents, the other party may file a motion to compel discovery to seek the court’s intervention.

## When a Motion to Compel Discovery Should Be Used

A Motion to Compel Discovery is appropriate when:

1. **A party fails to respond to discovery requests**\
   Such as interrogatories, requests for production of documents, or depositions.
2. **A party provides incomplete or evasive responses**\
   For example, answering questions without providing the requested documents.
3. **A party fails to comply with court orders regarding discovery**\
   If a court has already ordered disclosure and the party has not complied.
4. **There is a refusal to allow inspection or access to documents or evidence**\
   When a party withholds documents without proper justification.
5. **A party delays the discovery process**\
   Preventing timely access to information needed for the case.
