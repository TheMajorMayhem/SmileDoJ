# General Warrant (Not for Arrest)

A **General Warrant** (not for arrest) is a legal document that authorizes law enforcement or another designated party to search a person’s property or seize evidence related to a criminal investigation. Unlike an arrest warrant, which authorizes the detention of a person, a general warrant typically authorizes the search and seizure of property. It is usually issued by a court based on probable cause that evidence of a crime may be found at a specific location. The term "general" refers to the nature of the warrant, which may authorize broad searches or seizure of certain items.
