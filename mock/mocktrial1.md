## Case Summary

On the night of **March 14, 2024**, Jackson Price, a 32-year-old small business owner, was stopped by LSPD officers for a suspected DUI.

- **Excessive Force**: He claims officers tackled him to the ground unnecessarily.  
- **False Imprisonment**: He was held in custody longer than legally justified.
